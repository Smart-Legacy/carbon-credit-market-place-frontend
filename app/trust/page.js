            We can&apos;t “offset” our way to net zero. We need to use all the
            tools at our disposal to tackle the climate crisis. Emissions
            reductions should always be the first priority. Carbon credits are
            not an excuse for inaction on the important work of absolute
            emissions reductions.

            Not All Carbon Credits Are Created Equal
          </h2>
          <p>
            There are significant concerns among experts in the voluntary carbon
            market that many of the carbon credits available today do not
            achieve the climate benefits they claim. While quality standards are
            still being improved, independent third-party reviews are an
            indispensable tool for increasing transparency around carbon credit
            quality.

            If used responsibly and with integrity, carbon credits have the
            potential to be a powerful tool to fight climate change. While
            expectations around integrity continue to evolve, every organization
            must hold itself to high moral standards and make choices that
